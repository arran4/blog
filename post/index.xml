Probably needs to be looked at. I was going to try figure it out and provide a nice diagram of how it works, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have that much time to dedicate to this issue.
But I get stuff like this, when my login as expired, instead of just presenting a login page, it gives me this;</description></item><item><title>Aws New Glue Fail</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 15:25:28 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</guid><description>Ugh. So it turns out AWS Glue (the new interface) when you are writing a script using the editor won&amp;rsquo;t take into account the region when you click the &amp;ldquo;cloudwatch logs&amp;rdquo; link section: I have no idea how something like this could pass. But it has. Turns out it will default to us-east-1.
It seems to only occur in certain circumstances, however&amp;hellip; Once I have selected a region post login (or acocunt switch) it works fine.</description></item><item><title>Logitech G560</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/003-logitech-g560/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 23:16:23 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/003-logitech-g560/</guid><description>So I bought a new speaker&amp;hellip; A Logitech G560.. I had been eyeing this speaker for a while. I assure you it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of the sound changing aspect. But there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a lot to my reasons to pick it.
One of the major points to me picking this is, in the absence of a good list of alternatives, brand loyalty. But other than that.

Here is the first one.
Turns out Synology defaults the SSH to port 22&amp;hellip; Then if you have enabled the security advisor it constantly complains that is set to port 22.
Why not just set it to a random (but free) port?
If you have to manually configure SSH to turn it on then you would be aware that it&amp;rsquo;s not running on a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; port.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/001-first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/001-first-post/</guid><description>Just creating this blog. It&amp;rsquo;s 100% a copy of: https://github.com/arran4/githubpages
But I will add stuff to it. I intend to use this space to post more technical things. Probably just tech related complaints that are more wordy than Twitter will allow.
On the plus side it&amp;rsquo;s all managed by hugo!
Want to submit improvements to the layout.. Yes. But keep them small.</description></item></channel></rss>
