<p>Why!? Synology Mail Pro is decent and all. It feels like a management layer on a bunch of open source mail tools. Plus
and Android app which is quite nice. However it has a bunch of quirks which make me wonder if people actually use it inside
synology. Or at least various configurations.</p>
<p>One of the odd components of the synology mail system is the mail component isn&rsquo;t fully &ldquo;abstracted&rdquo; between components.
Which means you need to configure mail in a couple locations rather than just one. They have done a fairly good job TBH
but it isn&rsquo;t quite at the level it should be.. One of the quirks as a result is that (and I suspect this might be
because of my dkim and spam filter) that it catches it&rsquo;s own report email as not just spam.. But a virus!?</p>

<p>There is a high chance that this is a config error, however it should really be able to tell me or detect this to some
degree.</p>
