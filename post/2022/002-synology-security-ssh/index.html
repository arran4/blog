<p>So I will be writing tech complaints here.. Here is the first one.</p>
<p>Turns out Synology defaults the SSH to port 22&mldr; Then if you have enabled
the security advisor it constantly complains that is set to port 22.</p>
<p>Why not just set it to a random (but free) port?</p>
<p><img src=img.png alt=img.png></p>
<p>If you have to manually configure SSH to turn it on then you would be aware
that it&rsquo;s not running on a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; port. This also fails to acknowledge that
the port could be changed in synologys UPnP tool.</p>
<p>As much as I like Synology as it reduces the amount of work I have to do
maintaining a family NAS I do feel that the software could do &mldr; better. In this
case be aware of it&rsquo;s own Security Advisor and have &ldquo;safe&rdquo; defaults as a result,
as well as have a couple of configurations in mind. The software seems to allow
for the situation where you use the Synology NAS as a router directly configured
to the internet, but as well as where it&rsquo;s behind another router. But the software
seems to pick a particular profile on a per setting basis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any other recommendations which I have time to write here. I will post
more issues before coming up with a more wholistic recommendation than just to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use random ports</li>
<li>Have a &ldquo;find random free port&rdquo; button</li>
</ol>
