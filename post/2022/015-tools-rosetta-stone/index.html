<p>This is mostly just a list of things to remind me what to
install when I reformat / start using a new PC. But
I decided I would share anyway.</p>
<p>The prompt for creating this table wss actually discovering <a href=https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip>ksnip</a>
which resolved a lot of my cross platform screen shot pains.</p>

<td>The native clients are nice.. Lest in Mac. In windows it /freezes/ and is a little too noisy with notifications. Be nice if it muted the phone when you had it open too. -_- Facebook tries too hard to get your attention meaning I have had to mute it in as many places as I could.</td>

<td>This is everything you would want from a GPG key manager. It&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s .. simplish to use.. KDE saves the day. Makes setting up verified commits much easiier. I do have some UI complaints but that&rsquo;s for another posst.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Package manager</td>
<td>Winget / Ms App store</td>
<td>Default package manager, avoid snaps and &ldquo;developer tool&rdquo; installers</td>
<td>App store, avoid brew, and mac ports as much as possible.</td>
<td>This is an area where I use the system provided provided it isn&rsquo;t snapd and avoid most others. On Mac os x I would prefer to install things manually than use the solutions offered as they have broken many times and required more time to fix than it takes to update an Gentoo system. -_-</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Phone Link</td>
<td>Windows Phone Link</td>
<td>KDE Connect</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Don&rsquo;t use any on Mac because I use Android. Linux is pretty good but there is a massive difference between what Microsoft offers and what KDE offers making the two apps mutually incomparable and possibly compatible. Notification muting is something which is needed for both though.</td>

<p>Looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solutions which also work on Android</li>
<li>Compress Archive tool</li>
<li>2FA Tool</li>
<li>Password Manager with custom sync, used to use keypass but support for other OS was flaky</li>
<li>Anything to replace Electron</li>
<li>Video editor / Heavy screen recording</li>
<li>Qt toolkit</li>
<li>Extendable</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to suggestions. Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossplatform is key most other things are secondary</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s paid it needs to work on multiple computers with just one license</li>
<li>Open source is nice, especially if it&rsquo;s active and on github</li>
<li>Synchronises</li>
</ul>
<p>Also if you have your own list, add a comment here and if I like it, I will add it below!</p>
