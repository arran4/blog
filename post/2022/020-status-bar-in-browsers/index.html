<p>While I don&rsquo;t miss people using API to change the status bar text, something I can vaguely recall and I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s that useful as people don&rsquo;t look there that often. (Perhaps it was for help text.)</p>
<p>I do seem to miss the status bar, as a concept and in browsers specifically. While it was mostly use for
things such as the zoom level and SSL level, those things have been migrated to the address bar. &ndash; I guess
that is kind of okay as monitors have gotten wider &ndash;</p>
<p>I would still like the status bar to be something
devs can enable, so that they can see a count of the number of errors, or have an easy way to bring up the
console other than the numerous keyboard shortcuts..</p>

<p>I guess you can sort of get it by turning on the dev tools:</p>
<p><img src=img.png alt=img.png></p>
<p>And shrinking it down:</p>
<p><img src=img_2.png alt=img_2.png></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of not the same as it hasn&rsquo;t been designed to be there and you can&rsquo;t quickly toggle the dev
options back to the same size it was pre render.. I guess a bit like &ldquo;Shading&rdquo; in X windows.</p>
<p>It also helped to distinguish where a window ended. Although I can&rsquo;t produce the same example I can on
Windows and Linux, when I use mac as it has heavy shadows;</p>

<p>Maybe the designers of the Chrome UI a predominate Mac users? They certainly haven&rsquo;t considered Linux&rsquo;s
additional options, such as shading.</p>
