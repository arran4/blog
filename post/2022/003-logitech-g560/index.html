<p>So I bought a new speaker&mldr; A <a href=https://www.logitechg.com/en-au/products/gaming-audio/g560-rgb-gaming-speakers.980-001303.html>Logitech G560</a>..
I had been eyeing this speaker for a while. I assure you it wasn&rsquo;t because
of the sound changing aspect. But there wasn&rsquo;t really a lot to my reasons to pick it.</p>
<p>One of the major points to me picking this is, in the absence of a good list of alternatives, brand loyalty. But other
than that. I would have to say; Multiple input (Bluetooth, 3.5", USB); Price (got it on special 30ish% and priced matched
+5%.)</p>
<p>Although looking around there are some interesting alternatives, such as the: <a href=https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/personal-workspaces/logi-dock.html>Logi Dock</a>
but where would I get /that/ type of money from. (But the USB is super attractive.) It looks like it&rsquo;s very much web
conferencing inspired.</p>
<p>One thing that stands out with this is just how loud it is&mldr; I am listening to it, according to windows, at&mldr;.</p>
<p><img src=img.png alt=img.png></p>
<p>2% of its volume. I am pretty sure that&rsquo;s not exactly causing the most optimal listening experience. I will play around
with louder volumes when I can afford larger spaces.</p>
<p>What always surprises me is the software. It does one thing well, and that thing is usually it&rsquo;s name sake; in this case
LightSync RGB. I didn&rsquo;t think I would like it.. But I don&rsquo;t mind it TBH&mldr; I haven&rsquo;t turned it off. However (to really
no surprise) the software doesn&rsquo;t consider things, such as allowing me to set different profiles depending on &mldr; well
any other metric&mldr; Such as the time of day, for instance, I might want to synchronise it with my &ldquo;<a href=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136>Night Lite</a>&rdquo;
(Windows name for screen colour temperature.) However it does seem to offer LUA scripts I will have to play around with
however it would be nice if there were a couple out of the box. The profile component seems to be based around the
application being used.. Almost always a game:</p>
<p><img src=img_1.png alt=img_1.png></p>
<p>I have created 2 desktop profiles:</p>
<p><img src=img_2.png alt=img_2.png></p>
<p>However the interface is hard to use mostly because it&rsquo;s hard to get a mental model around where you&rsquo;re in the application
quickly. The navigation looks a bit like this (omitting a lot of options:)</p>
<p><img src=img_3.png alt=img_3.png></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird having no way of getting from the &ldquo;View Settings Summary&rdquo; to &ldquo;Modify Settings.&rdquo; It seems I have to make
the profile active to make any changes to it. With the exception of scripting changes. Having written my own share of bad
UX navigation experiences I can tell this was written for the person making the software, and very little of actual
profiling peoples uses outside of playing games has been considered. I mean the RBG meme of just throwing lights on
everything definitely seems to apply here. Like what &ldquo;The Checkout&rdquo; calls <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JDmb_f3E2c">Pink Marketing</a>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKwYJ9eoV4Y">also</a>) but for gamers.</p>
<p>Anyway all for now.</p>
