<h1 itemprop=name id=title>Back to KDE My Observations</h1>
<span class="f6 gray">August 20, 2022</span>
<article itemprop=articleBody id=content class="w-90 lh-copy">
<p>Okay having used Windows and Mac OS for a couple years. Mostly due to driver issues. (Which didn&rsquo;t abate,
I had to effectively buy a new computer to solve my issues. Which is rather disappointing but I think
I will be moving back to a desktop / laptop hybrid model again. Laptops have disappointed me recently but
that&rsquo;s a conversation for another day.</p>
<h1 id=title-bar-customization>Title bar customization</h1>
<p>So the move to KDE has been pretty nice in the most part. I vastly enjoy having a lot more power user
functionality back that I lost. Such as &ldquo;Window manager&rdquo; native support for shading and &ldquo;always above&rdquo; and
&ldquo;always below&rdquo;. Especially being able to customize it so that I can click them directly:
<img src=img.png alt=img.png></p>
<p>How-ever I tried the &ldquo;Application Menu&rdquo; option.. Turned that off, increased clicks at no added benefit.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed this so much I have told Chrome that I want it to only use &ldquo;Native&rdquo; UI borders. While I have
lost a couple of pixels it has been worth it interms of added functionality. Now I can move the desktop and
activity of a Chrome window MUCH easier. Applications shouldn&rsquo;t be replacing native menus in most cases IMHO
need we remind people of the &ldquo;Slack crash&rdquo; disaster where people couldn&rsquo;t close slack because slack redraws
application borders / title bar, but the JS fails when the server is down. -_-</p>
<h1 id=shading>Shading</h1>
<p>So pretty happy with that&mldr; Although it seems most applications can&rsquo;t handle been &ldquo;Shaded&rdquo; and instead
resize to the 0 height mode.. Something I don&rsquo;t recall ever happening with KDE 3 and earlier (long live TDE
<a href=https://www.trinitydesktop.org/>https://www.trinitydesktop.org/</a> )</p>
<p>Shaded:</p>
<p><img src=img_1.png alt=img_1.png></p>
<p>Unshade fail:</p>
<p><img src=img_2.png alt=img_2.png></p>
<p>I was kind of expecting a native KDE app, like the KDE System Settings to handle being shaded. Apparently
I was wrong for expecting it.</p>
<h1 id=activities-and-desktops>Activities and desktops</h1>
<p>Something I don&rsquo;t quite understand are activities. I get they are supposed to provide some level of isolation
but I can&rsquo;t seem to set different settings per desktop. Such as I would expect to be able to control the
number of virtual desktops independently. However I can&rsquo;t.. They do have a redeeming factor and that is
unlike Virtual Desktops I can set keyboard shortcuts to jump to any particular virtual desktop with ease.
Which is nice. However when I use the activities tabber it seems to want to sort by &ldquo;most recent&rdquo; rather
than retain any sort of order.</p>
<p>Virtual desktops have become strange.. It&rsquo;s clearly a grid, however when I add desktops, I have to do it
for each &ldquo;Row&rdquo;.. It numbers the virtual desktops, however I find positional based vritual desktops far
more handy, however I don&rsquo;t see any way of managing that automatically:
<img src=img_3.png alt=img_3.png></p>
<p>So here I am naiming my virtual desktops manually. -_- (I have since added a center row.) This seems like
way too much work.. Also my other activities I would like only one virtual desktop. Why? They are only
for &ldquo;Music&rdquo; and &ldquo;Games&rdquo;:
<img src=img_4.png alt=img_4.png></p>
<p>The rules are surprisingly hard to configure, especially with electron. I basically had to use the force
setting as it seems Spotify changes it&rsquo;s descriptors. If only I could do it by application path but I
gather the X api probably doesn&rsquo;t allow that level of inspection.</p>
<h1 id=consistency>Consistency</h1>
<p>There is a surprsingly poor level of consistency amongst applications. I don&rsquo;t mind per say. However it
would be nice to have more of the action buttons on the lists/listviews around the place. Such as in
the settings windows view from above it has:
<img src=img_5.png alt=img_5.png></p>
<p>However it doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist in Kmail when configuring accounts where it would be a bit more useful,
or even in KOrganizer which would help when setting multiple events:
<img src=img_6.png alt=img_6.png></p>
<h1 id=korganizer>KOrganizer</h1>
<p>I also can&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to easily configure default reminders. However there are some nice
features that other applications should adopt. Such as the &ldquo;quick&rdquo; dates:
<img src=img_7.png alt=img_7.png></p>
<p>However once again, this is only limited in applications. Gmail thanks to the &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; experiment has an
equivalent:
<img src=img_8.png alt=img_8.png></p>
<p>However it can only have a couple positions, and they only use it in a couple locations. Basically the same
issue as KDE. KDE however doesn&rsquo;t seem to apply it to times.. I would like to be able to set: 8am, 12pm,
1pm, 5pm and 10pm as &ldquo;standard&rdquo; times I would want to set something to be due.</p>
<p>I really do like the &ldquo;Reminder&rdquo; Daemon popups.. They don&rsquo;t steal focus, but are visible, don&rsquo;t make a noise,
and allow you to address multiple issues at once, with clear actions, such as snooze or dismiss:
<img src=img_9.png alt=img_9.png></p>
<p>Much better than this shit:
<img src=img_10.png alt=img_10.png></p>
<p>Which has become the default for messaging. I don&rsquo;t know why I need to get a message /every/ single time
someone presses enter on a message. Also unless I want a preview previews aren&rsquo;t helping me too much..</p>
<p>I do like the countdown in the dismiss component though:
<img src=img_11.png alt=img_11.png></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice touch.</p>
<p>Although for some reason the KOrganizer reminder daemon was disabled at the start, and set not to auto
start&mldr;
<img src=img_12.png alt=img_12.png></p>
<p>This is counter to my expectations. I had to look for it&mldr; It&rsquo;s amazing I didn&rsquo;t have to use google to
figure out what was going on with this. I was eventually able to find it by expanding the notification
section and from there I was able to turn it on.</p>
<p><img src=img_13.png alt=img_13.png></p>
<h1 id=kmail>Kmail</h1>
<p>I really like the fact that Kmail just shows me that there is mail in the &ldquo;system tray&rdquo; without having
a popup&mldr;</p>
<p><img src=img_14.png alt=img_14.png></p>
<p>Although I probably turned notifications off:
<img src=img_15.png alt=img_15.png></p>
<p>So perhaps I&rsquo;m giving it too much credit..</p>
<p>However Kmail seems to have MASSIVE problems with large folders in Gmail, such as &ldquo;All mail&rdquo;. It takes ages
to sync a folder and often seems to crash or get stuck, which I have to manually cancel everything, and
then &ldquo;restart&rdquo; the &ldquo;account&rdquo; in &ldquo;account manager&rdquo;. I kind of wish that the Akonadi Log viewier was
emdedded in Kmail so I could check the status there. Along with designed for the app.</p>
<p>Also when the system got stuck checking the imap folders for changes, it would cause EVERYTHING else to block,
so, when I deleted a calendar item, it wouldn&rsquo;t delete, so I did it twice, later on, I randomly got this:
<img src=img_16.png alt=img_16.png></p>
<p>Thanks&mldr; Imap is designed to allow concurrent requests. My guess is that the KDE Imap client is rather
primitive. I would love to work on fixing that, if I could get paid for doing so&mldr; Know someone that is
happy to pay me for doing that let me know please!</p>
<p>But I get very used to seeing this:
<img src=img_17.png alt=img_17.png></p>
<p>My solution around it is to go offline then go online when I want to do anything. However Kmail clearly
isn&rsquo;t built for Gmail as it tries to move my &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; items to the local trash folder rather than by
default into an appropraite location in the imap server. Which for gmail is actually &ldquo;All Mail&rdquo; as Kmail
doesn&rsquo;t seem to support the idea of an &ldquo;archive&rdquo; for all mail, instead it supports the tried and true,
archive to reduce the folder size. Which I guess there isn&rsquo;t much wrong with that as it&rsquo;s just a difference
in opinion.</p>
<p>However the fact that it can block me from moving, and even seeing mail like this:
<img src=img_18.png alt=img_18.png></p>
<p>Is rather confronting. I can think of a couple solutions but without time to look at what&rsquo;s going on
under the hood I don&rsquo;t know what the realities are of the situation.</p>
<p>But I really do like the sort by date view it presents:
<img src=img_19.png alt=img_19.png></p>
<p>It also for the number of items (over half a million in some of my folders) renders it VERY quickly. If
I could get the imap stuff going I could move to Kmail for email, and remain on gmail on my mobile until
the day KDE has a &ldquo;Mobile Klient.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id=account-configuration>Account Configuration</h1>
<p>There seems to be 2 places to configure accounts one being in the specific applications, such as Kopete
and Kmail, and then one at the &ldquo;KDE&rdquo; level in system settings. (No screenshots sorry.) I find this really
confusing as I don&rsquo;t know the scope of access or what it does, and I can&rsquo;t seem to give it access in part.</p>
<p>I have setup one of my gmail accounts there, which I think provides it to kopete.. I&rsquo;m not sure. However
it&rsquo;s so badly misconfigured it&rsquo;s unusable, as I get this dialog:
<img src=img_20.png alt=img_20.png></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.. I am not going to accept that. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on but I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<h1 id=notifications-again>Notifications, again</h1>
<p>Once again I must speak about notifications. I love all the settings:
<img src=img_21.png alt=img_21.png></p>
<p>However sometimes I can be a bit hard to find things like this:
<img src=img_22.png alt=img_22.png></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s burried under the option:
<img src=img_23.png alt=img_23.png></p>
<p>I would expect more prominence on that.</p>
<p>I have setup KDE connect, however I can&rsquo;t seem to customize the notifications I get from it. Even though
the option seems to exist:</p>
<p><img src=img_24.png alt=img_24.png></p>
<p>I think because it isn&rsquo;t fully deterministic as to what messages I get it won&rsquo;t help me.. However with
something as over bearing as Akonadi I would expect it to cache distinct notifications, or to at least
give me regexp filters or something..</p>
<h1 id=settings-again>Settings, again</h1>
<p>In my dot files, I have a <code>.face.icon</code> <a href=https://github.com/arran4/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_face.icon>https://github.com/arran4/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_face.icon</a> file
configured. SDDM seems to handle it fine.. KDE Settings, not at all:
<img src=img_25.png alt=img_25.png></p>
<p>No idea why that is, but I am assuming it&rsquo;s some sort of standard? Perhaps XDG? (Perhaps not <a href=https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html</a>)
Maybe free desktop? No idea. But I&rsquo;m surprised that isn&rsquo;t supported.</p>
<p>Although Kmail supports gravatar, so maybe that&rsquo;s where they are going with it?</p>
<p>Backup options seems to only support USB:
<img src=img_26.png alt=img_26.png></p>
<p>However I have a Synology NAS, so SFTP, SMB, or anything would be nice.</p>
<p>I do like the configuration options. And also the integration with KDE looks:
<img src=img_27.png alt=img_27.png></p>
<p>Even though it can be prohibitively blocking to explore:
<img src=img_28.png alt=img_28.png></p>
<p>Prefetching, downloading larger chucks might be nice? But I guess they are trying to go search first&mldr;
I am not sure how useful that is to me as I am searching for a look&mldr;. Not like I can just specify the
keywords for a look because some of the descriptions leave much to be desired:
<img src=img_29.png alt=img_29.png></p>
<p>But even if it was, it&rsquo;s not like it would make it more discoverable:
<a href=https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki>https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki</a></p>
<p>Perhaps a &ldquo;show 10 random&rdquo; button might help? IDK.</p>
<h1 id=crashes>Crashes</h1>
<p>It crashes a lot.. But the good news is that I don&rsquo;t feel helpless. I do get to log it:
<img src=img_30.png alt=img_30.png></p>
<p>And people do respond to tickets although I was not that helpful. I will have to work on that.</p>
<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I am enjoying KDE. Although it seems that I have a lot to say on the matter, these are just issues. I
would love to be paid to work on it. But given that it&rsquo;s FOSS I don&rsquo;t think that is going to happen.</p>
<p>I did miss using KDE as my main desktop, which I don&rsquo;t think I have done since 2016ish.. And I don&rsquo;t think
I have seriously used KDE&rsquo;s Kontact suite since 2008ish, when I moved off Gentoo, moved house and other
things. It seems that the imap issues remain, and it crashes a bit more but I have hope those can be
resolved.</p>
<p>My goals was really to write down some of my issues somewhere so they don&rsquo;t have to sit in my head. Sadly
I don&rsquo;t think that a lot of what I wrote at the level I wrote it is appropriate for a bug tracker or any
thing anywhere interesting. But I write mostly for myself. Sorry if you take the wrong view, or if I
discourage you. I don&rsquo;t mean to. Using KDE again has been a positive and there is a lot that is right
with it. I just needed to write what bothers me. I will continue to do so for my own benefit if not others.</p>
