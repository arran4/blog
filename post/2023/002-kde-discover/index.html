<p>I find this KDE application really annoying. I understand what it&rsquo;s trying to do. But it just feels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Too slow in comparison to the CLI</li>
<li>It hides too much information
<ol>
<li>Previous errors</li>
<li>Packages that are being updated</li>
<li>In settings, it doesn&rsquo;t show the URLs or anything advanced for the repo</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It requires too much waiting between actions, it does very little async</li>
<li>Error messages are showing as UI blocking &ldquo;notification&rdquo; then disappear, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a log somewhere.</li>
<li>Provides almost no options to correct common errors &ndash; which it could collect and suggest!</li>
<li>Snap is non-optional</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=img.png alt=img.png></p>
<p>I just find it pretty frustrating. I wish it would be more useful and resolve the feeling based issues from above.</p>
<p>One mode I really want it to have is &ldquo;Update on shutdown or restart&rdquo; then as a result dismiss the tray icon.</p>
<p>Back in the 200xs I would have loved to be a paid KDE dev and even now that seems tempting but probably to many other
people. However, I would fix things to my own ideals.</p>
