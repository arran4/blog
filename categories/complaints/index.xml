Something else I also do is use one account for all my work regardless of the computer I&amp;rsquo;m on.
However that means you encounter issues with software which wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly designed for users who operate under different &amp;ldquo;aliases&amp;rdquo; on the same account. Such as, when I&amp;rsquo;m working for one of my clients, I do all my commits under the email address associated with that organisation.</description></item><item><title>Simple Screen Recorder</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/017-simple-screen-recorder/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 18:14:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/017-simple-screen-recorder/</guid><description>SimpleScreenRecorder, the best simple screen recorder on linux that I know of.. I think it might be a wrapper around some shell commands. IDK.. But it would be nice if it were ported to other systems. Until then I use OBS which is overkill for most of what I do.. (Also in Windows Screen2Gif isn&amp;rsquo;t bad either.)
Got it working on a system with nVidia and got this error:
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what this means, what it does, or how to undo it.</description></item><item><title>Git Bash and WSL on Windows Terminal Preview vs IntelliJ</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/011-git-bash-and-wsl-on-windows-terminal-preview-vs-intellij/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 10:03:29 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/011-git-bash-and-wsl-on-windows-terminal-preview-vs-intellij/</guid><description>For some reason IntelliJ and Windows terminal discover available shells in different ways, but either way is not ideal. (In-fact IntelliJ uses two different means of discovery.)
The terminal popup in Intellj seems to be unaware of Gitbash..
Which is in complete contrast to the terminal settings (same plugin) which is unaware of my WSL deployments. (Possibly because it&amp;rsquo;s using a file path based system) Which means I can&amp;rsquo;t set Debian WSL as my default terminal in IntelliJ.</description></item><item><title>Aws New Glue Fail</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 15:25:28 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</guid><description>Ugh. So it turns out AWS Glue (the new interface) when you are writing a script using the editor won&amp;rsquo;t take into account the region when you click the &amp;ldquo;cloudwatch logs&amp;rdquo; link section: I have no idea how something like this could pass. But it has. Turns out it will default to us-east-1.
It seems to only occur in certain circumstances, however&amp;hellip; Once I have selected a region post login (or acocunt switch) it works fine.</description></item><item><title>Synology Security Advisor and SSH</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:12:08 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</guid><description>So I will be writing tech complaints here.. Here is the first one.
Turns out Synology defaults the SSH to port 22&amp;hellip; Then if you have enabled the security advisor it constantly complains that is set to port 22.
Why not just set it to a random (but free) port?
If you have to manually configure SSH to turn it on then you would be aware that it&amp;rsquo;s not running on a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; port.</description></item></channel></rss>
