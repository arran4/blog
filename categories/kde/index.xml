I find this KDE application really annoying. I understand what it&amp;rsquo;s trying to do. But it just feels:
Too slow in comparison to the CLI It hides too much information Previous errors Packages that are being updated In settings, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the URLs or anything advanced for the repo It requires too much waiting between actions, it does very little async Error messages are showing as UI blocking &amp;ldquo;notification&amp;rdquo; then disappear, there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a log somewhere.</description></item><item><title>Back to KDE My Observations</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/016-back-to-kde-my-observations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 16:43:13 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/016-back-to-kde-my-observations/</guid><description>Okay having used Windows and Mac OS for a couple years. Mostly due to driver issues. (Which didn&amp;rsquo;t abate, I had to effectively buy a new computer to solve my issues. Which is rather disappointing but I think I will be moving back to a desktop / laptop hybrid model again. Laptops have disappointed me recently but that&amp;rsquo;s a conversation for another day.

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what caused it. But it might be because it was already set, or that it ended with a :

Actually a bit more looking around and it turns out it is if XDG_DATA_DIRS contains the same entry twice it crashes.</description></item><item><title>KDE and Changing Mouse Scroll Speed</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/008-kde-and-changing-mouse-scroll-speed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 22:02:12 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/008-kde-and-changing-mouse-scroll-speed/</guid><description>So.. Turns out the control pannel mess that exists on Windows is contagious. After 2 years of using Windows (because of driver issues) I have finally been able to switch back to Linux.. However I got used to a couple settings. One was a faster mouse scroll speed&amp;hellip; So I go to configure that and this is what I see: A quick google got me here: https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?t=160416
