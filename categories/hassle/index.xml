I would rather write here that I found this issue than log it myself. Because from what I recall from the bug logging process it can be pretty tedious. Especially with bugzilla. Perhaps Github / Gitlab has spoiled me with the ability to log very simple bugs quickly and easily.
Maybe because web based interfaces were so hard to use back in the 90s, it was tedious to go through bug reports so simply reduce them by getting as much info upfront as possible including classification.</description></item></channel></rss>
