I ended up setting my own Matrix server on my synology. However, it occurred to me that if Synology were to adopt open 
standards their provided apps, like Synology Chat would be substantially more useful. Especially since they have built 
out encryption in a similar way to how it works in Matrix, least at the surface level. Plus they would get a much larger
user base. -- Even if it was a couple specs behind it would be quite useful as it would effectively be a managed deploy
for me.
