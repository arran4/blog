This is mostly just a list of things to remind me what to
install when I reformat / start using a new PC. But
I decided I would share anyway.

The prompt for creating this table wss actually discovering [ksnip](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip)
which resolved a lot of my cross platform screen shot pains.

Looking for:

* Solutions which also work on Android
* Compress Archive tool
* 2FA Tool 
* Password Manager with custom sync, used to use keypass but support for other OS was flaky
* Anything to replace Electron
* Video editor / Heavy screen recording
* Qt toolkit
* Extendable 

I'm open to suggestions. Remember:

* Crossplatform is key most other things are secondary
* If it's paid it needs to work on multiple computers with just one license
* Open source is nice, especially if it's active and on github
* Synchronises

Also if you have your own list, add a comment here and if I like it, I will add it below!
