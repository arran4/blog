Mostly due to driver issues. (Which didn&amp;rsquo;t abate, I had to effectively buy a new computer to solve my issues. Which is rather disappointing but I think I will be moving back to a desktop / laptop hybrid model again. Laptops have disappointed me recently but that&amp;rsquo;s a conversation for another day.
Title bar customization So the move to KDE has been pretty nice in the most part.</description></item><item><title>KDE and Changing Mouse Scroll Speed</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/008-kde-and-changing-mouse-scroll-speed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 22:02:12 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/008-kde-and-changing-mouse-scroll-speed/</guid><description>So..

But it seems that with a default install of KDE it the Akregator (RSS feed reader) comes pre configured with the KDE blog which doesn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly. -_-
Not that it matters it seems there isn&amp;rsquo;t any syncing ability in Akregator meaning I will stick with Miniflux for now.</description></item></channel></rss>
