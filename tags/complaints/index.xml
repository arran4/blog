Something else I also do is use one account for all my work regardless of the computer I&amp;rsquo;m on.
However that means you encounter issues with software which wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly designed for users who operate under different &amp;ldquo;aliases&amp;rdquo; on the same account. Such as, when I&amp;rsquo;m working for one of my clients, I do all my commits under the email address associated with that organisation.</description></item><item><title>Synology Office Encryption</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/005-synology-office-encryption/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 11:25:18 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/005-synology-office-encryption/</guid><description>The login process and decryption/password-protected document workflow with Synology Office is not great. Probably needs to be looked at. I was going to try figure it out and provide a nice diagram of how it works, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have that much time to dedicate to this issue.
But I get stuff like this, when my login as expired, instead of just presenting a login page, it gives me this;</description></item><item><title>Aws New Glue Fail</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 15:25:28 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/004-aws-new-glue-fail/</guid><description>Ugh. So it turns out AWS Glue (the new interface) when you are writing a script using the editor won&amp;rsquo;t take into account the region when you click the &amp;ldquo;cloudwatch logs&amp;rdquo; link section: I have no idea how something like this could pass. But it has. Turns out it will default to us-east-1.
It seems to only occur in certain circumstances, however&amp;hellip; Once I have selected a region post login (or account switch) it works fine.</description></item><item><title>Logitech G560</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/003-logitech-g560/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 23:16:23 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/003-logitech-g560/</guid><description>So I bought a new speaker&amp;hellip; A Logitech G560.. I had been eyeing this speaker for a while. I assure you it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of the sound changing aspect. But there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a lot to my reasons to pick it.
One of the major points to me picking this is, in the absence of a good list of alternatives, brand loyalty. But other than that. I would have to say; Multiple input (Bluetooth, 3.</description></item><item><title>Synology Security Advisor and SSH</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:12:08 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</guid><description>So I will be writing tech complaints here.. Here is the first one.
Turns out Synology defaults the SSH to port 22&amp;hellip; Then if you have enabled the security advisor it constantly complains that is set to port 22.
Why not just set it to a random (but free) port?
If you have to manually configure SSH to turn it on then you would be aware that it&amp;rsquo;s not running on a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; port.</description></item></channel></rss>
