Which means when you get an error message you can copy and paste the text to aid you in your search. This also means that links work.
A lot of web pages seem to have failed to grasp this, and have made sections of their application &amp;ldquo;unselectable&amp;rdquo;, links &amp;ldquo;unclickable&amp;rdquo; and more annoyingly but less importantly, have failed to place white space between distinct elements which means when you go to select text (often by double-clicking and dragging in my case) you &amp;ldquo;over match&amp;rdquo; and select elements that are unintended:</description></item><item><title>Synology Mail Reports Caught by Synology Spam Detector -- Why!?</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/025-synology-mail-reports-caught-by-synology-spam-detector--why/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 08:48:53 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/025-synology-mail-reports-caught-by-synology-spam-detector--why/</guid><description>Why!? Synology Mail Pro is decent and all. It feels like a management layer on a bunch of open source mail tools. Plus and Android app which is quite nice. However it has a bunch of quirks which make me wonder if people actually use it inside synology. Or at least various configurations.
One of the odd components of the synology mail system is the mail component isn&amp;rsquo;t fully &amp;ldquo;abstracted&amp;rdquo; between components.</description></item><item><title>Synology Cloudsync and Folder Listing</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/021-synology-cloudsync-and-folder-listing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 08:51:02 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/021-synology-cloudsync-and-folder-listing/</guid><description>Not sure why &amp;ldquo;Drive&amp;rdquo; gets it&amp;rsquo;s own icon but all of my cloud sync items don&amp;rsquo;t especially considering that it has all the icons already setup:</description></item><item><title>Synology Office Encryption</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/005-synology-office-encryption/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 11:25:18 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/005-synology-office-encryption/</guid><description>The login process and decryption/passworded document workflow with Synology Office is not great. Probably needs to be looked at. I was going to try figure it out and provide a nice diagram of how it works, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have that much time to dedicate to this issue.
But I get stuff like this, when my login as expired, instead of just presenting a login page, it gives me this;</description></item><item><title>Synology Security Advisor and SSH</title><link>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:12:08 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://arran4.github.io/blog/post/2022/002-synology-security-ssh/</guid><description>So I will be writing tech complaints here.. Here is the first one.
Turns out Synology defaults the SSH to port 22&amp;hellip; Then if you have enabled the security advisor it constantly complains that is set to port 22.
Why not just set it to a random (but free) port?
If you have to manually configure SSH to turn it on then you would be aware that it&amp;rsquo;s not running on a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; port.</description></item></channel></rss>
