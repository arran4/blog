Made me think about my previous comment. If they offered a more &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; service which included value added things like email processing etc. It would definitely make it seem more worth it.
I think they should offer domain services and some email services for free still, however they can add more services along that lines. Such as an &amp;ldquo;email proxy&amp;rdquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to directly expose port 25, (and maybe 110) for instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
