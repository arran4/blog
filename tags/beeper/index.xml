While I haven&amp;rsquo;t done too much with it directly. I did attempt to read the spec etc. However, it seems a bit &amp;hellip; large for what it is. I have been using a couple Matrix clients and a couple matrix servers/services. Namely, Beeper is the primary one.
I do enjoy Beeper, and support what Beeper is attempting to accomplish.</description></item></channel></rss>
